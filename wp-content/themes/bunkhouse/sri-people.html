        <div class="bio grid_ten">Douglas M. DeChant, AIA, NCARB<br />Founding Partner/Principal<br />dougd@sriarchitect.com<br />
            <p class="bio grid_ten">Architecture is more than a profession for Doug, our principal designer; it is a calling, understood since childhood. While a modernist at heart, his work reflects the necessary context of each setting and the voice of each client. He trained in the program of modernist and former Bauhaus director Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe, at Illinois Institute of Technology’s School of Architecture in Chicago. After working throughout the nation and overseas, Doug settled in Vail in 1985, where he met his wife, Charlotte. Together they founded the practice in 1989 and have enjoyed raising four amazing children.</p>
            <p class="bio grid_ten">Doug’s service has included the Eagle County, Colorado, Planning Commission; the faculty of the Byron Fellowship, an annual sustainable communities conference; panelist at the Summit for Creativity in La Jolla sponsored by The Design Futures Council; participation in local design review boards; youth sports coaching; and various lay-leadership positions in his church. In 2004, he conceived ‘Benevolent Architecture’, a proprietary service offering low-cost or no-cost architecture and consulting to worthy ministries and non-profits. In 2005, Doug began to develop an intimate, artistic retreat and conference venue, Wellspring Ranch, LLC, relocating and restoring several historic Colorado structures upon a remarkable property outside of Buena Vista, Colorado.</p>
            <p class="bio grid_ten">He is a member of the American Institute of Architects, certified by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards, and has been licensed in numerous states, including Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Indiana, Georgia and Pennsylvania. He finds balance in guitar, sculpture, hiking, snowshoeing, golf and crafting various elements of his retreat venue.</p>

        <div class="bio grid_ten">Charlotte R. DeChant, M. Arch.<br />Founding Partner<br />charlotte@sriarchitect.com<br />
        <p class="bio grid_ten">As a young artist, Charlotte tailored her pre-architecture undergraduate degree at Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, and completed her Master of Architecture at the University of Colorado, Denver. With her fresh eyes, she is an observer, analyst and critic of our processes, and her imagination inspires and contributes to our creativity. Of the partners, Charlotte’s willingness to raise the children fostered Doug’s ability to focus upon the practice.</p>
        <p class="bio grid_ten">She is a lifelong resident of Colorado, skied Vail in the early years as a child and remains an excellent bump skier (if the sun is shining). She was an original teammate of the Vail Breakaways, Vail’s first women’s hockey team. Charlotte’s vision includes an amazing gift for seeing, rescuing, restoring and placing cast-off furniture and other elements, giving the pieces valuable, renewed lives.</p>

            <div class="bio grid_ten">Tom Cole, AIA<br />Design Architect<br />tomc@sriarchitect.com<br />
            <p class="bio grid_ten">After earning his degree from the University of Cincinnati, Tom combined his love of the sporting mountain life with his passion for architecture by moving to Vail, Colorado in 1989.  He practiced for 13 years at Morter Architects, rising through apprenticeship while developing uncommon design skills, to become a partner with his friend and mentor, Jim Morter in 2001.  Upon that studio closing in 2009, Tom practiced solo, as Tom Cole Architect, where his focus upon ranchlands of the American West, conservation and ranch architecture began to flourish.  Tom joined us in 2015, in response to our search for a gifted design architect and his interest to again join a dynamic studio.  Our collective passions and skills have resulted in an amazing collaboration.</p>
            <p class="bio grid_ten">Tom is a gifted, instinctive designer.  Engaging, highly descriptive architectural studies, sketches, graphics, and renderings flow easily, quickly and directly from his hand.  He is an unparalleled collaborative partner, both in the studio and with our clients.</p>

        <p class="bio grid_ten">After graduating from Illinois Institute of Technology’s School of Architecture in 1994, and interning for three years at Fujikawa Johnson and Associates in Chicago, Adam packed his van and toured America for several months, to determine where he might settle. He found Vail and us about the same time in 1997 and didn’t move beyond. For the past sixteen years has been a stalwart of our studio. Adam is a strong, collaborative design voice, and has managed some of our most complex and leading edge custom homes with a designer’s sensitivity. His priority upon sustainability, his leadership skills and his mentoring of the younger staff uphold the core values of our practice. He is licensed in Colorado and serves as the senior member of the Red Sky Ranch Design Review Board. Adam is a skilled golfer, raced on his high school ski team, and together with his wife, it would be difficult to find a more committed pair of music fans.</p>
